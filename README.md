During the 100 days of the Save Soil movement, an acknowledgement tracker wasÂ utilised to maintain tabs on the acknowledgements of twitter activity.
It's a drive folder with multiple sheets of Earth Buddies categorized by different centers in each state.

Activity Tracker is made with the help of various excel features.

The group coordinator had access to the group sheets, and it was updated every day. 
At the end of each day, we were monitoring these 10 groups by looking at the Dashboard sheet, which connected all 10 sheets. This sheet utilizes a number of Excel capabilities to make activity monitoring simple.
